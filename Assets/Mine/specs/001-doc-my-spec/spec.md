**Feature Branch**: `001-doc-my-spec`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A 3D game for mobile and pc (different layout) about a character looting weapon and fighting monsters. The game has multiple maps, there are two types of map, resting map and fighting map. The resting map is the place where player can buy, sell, store, upgrade there items and weapons. The fighting map is where there are monsters and items around. In fighting map, there will be an interactable object allow player to activate the challenge in the current map. The challenge will have limited several stages that happen in a period of time and monsters comeout from entries points. In that moment, player cannot get out of map but only fight till dead or win. It also has shopping, inventory, trading mechanism and fully UI/UX in game over, game start, save game,..."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: Are monsters present in fighting maps before challenge activation, or only during challenges? ‚Üí A: Monsters roam freely before challenges; challenge spawns different/stronger ones
- Q: What happens when a player dies during a challenge or from ambient monsters? ‚Üí A: Respawn at resting map, lose percentage of currency
- Q: Is inventory capacity limited by slots, weight, or both? ‚Üí A: No capacity limited
- Q: Is trading with NPCs, other players, or both? ‚Üí A: NPCs only (single-player trading)
- Q: Which platforms should be supported: iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux, or specific combinations? ‚Üí A: Windows, Android

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A player launches the game and begins their journey. They start in a resting map where they can prepare for combat by purchasing weapons and upgrading items using resources they've collected. When ready, they travel to a fighting map where they encounter ambient monsters roaming freely and can explore to find lootable weapons and items scattered throughout the environment. Upon finding an interactable challenge object, they can activate a staged combat challenge where stronger challenge-specific monsters spawn from designated entry points in waves. The player must survive all stages within the time limit to win, or they lose if defeated. After completing or failing the challenge, they return to a resting map to manage their inventory, sell unwanted items, store valuables, and prepare for the next challenge.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a player is in a resting map, **When** they access the shop interface, **Then** they can view available weapons and items, see prices, and complete purchase transactions using their currency
2. **Given** a player is in a fighting map, **When** they approach an item on the ground, **Then** they can loot it and add it to their inventory
3. **Given** a player is in a fighting map with a challenge object, **When** they interact with the challenge object, **Then** the challenge begins with monsters spawning in stages over time
4. **Given** a challenge is active, **When** the player attempts to exit the map, **Then** they are prevented from leaving until the challenge is won or they are defeated
5. **Given** a player defeats all challenge stages within the time limit, **When** the final monster is defeated, **Then** they receive rewards and the challenge ends successfully
6. **Given** a player has items in their inventory, **When** they access the storage system in a resting map, **Then** they can deposit and retrieve items
7. **Given** a player needs to continue their game, **When** they access the save system, **Then** their progress is saved and can be restored later
8. **Given** a player is using Android mobile vs Windows PC, **When** they view the game interface, **Then** the UI layout adapts appropriately to the platform

### Edge Cases
- When a player dies (from ambient monsters or during challenge), they respawn at a resting map and lose a percentage of their currency
- What happens when time runs out during a challenge before all stages are complete?
- How does the system handle selling items that are currently equipped?
- How does save game interact with active challenges?
- What happens when a player attempts to upgrade an item without sufficient resources?
- Players can trade items and weapons with NPCs in resting maps (single-player only, no multiplayer trading)
